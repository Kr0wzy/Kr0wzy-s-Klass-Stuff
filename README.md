# Kr0wzy-s-Klass-Stuff

- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kr0wzy
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about other programming languages. Especially since it's been a while since I last worked on this stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about the java language.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on improving my programming skills.
- 📫 How to reach me may vary depending on the email address I choose.

This repository is for school stuff ONLY. At least, until I'm done with the course, or until I decide to do something with it
Who knows?

Either way, nothing else is to be put here.

EVER!
